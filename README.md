geo-timescale
=============

A modular D3.js-based geologic time scale that utilizes data from the [Paleobiology Database](http://paleobiodb.org).

To use, simply include ````timescale.js```` and ````timescale.css```` in your HTML document, and initialize into the div of your choice with ````timescale.init("id-of-div")````.

The package is published at NPM at `@macrostrat/d3-timescale`.
